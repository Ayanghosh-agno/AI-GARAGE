Unlike a manual garage door, the smart garage door gives a tough time to the thieves for entering the house. The project provides the user with a simple monitoring system that enables them to act more security conscious, effectively increasing the safety and security of their home. The device consists of a transmitting unit in the garage that tracks the door’s position, and a portable, wireless receiving device in the house that displays the garage door’s status.
